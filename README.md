# The Discovery of Handwashing: [[Code](https://github.com/OmarAlkousa/The-Discovery-of-Handwashing/blob/main/Dr.%20Semmelweis%20and%20the%20Discovery%20of%20Handwashing/notebook.ipynb)]

This is mainly one of the interseting [DataCamp](https://app.datacamp.com/learn) projects by [Rasmus Bååth](https://www.datacamp.com/instructors/rasmus-baath). The idea of the project is to re-analyse the data behind one of the most important discoveries of modern medicine, Handwashing...

> In 1847, the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis made a breakthough discovery: he discovers handwashing. Contaminated hands was a major cause of childbed fever and by enforcing handwashing at his hospital he saved hundreds of lives. I got interested in this project because it's related to my field, Biomedical Engineering.

### A lot of topics you would learn while walking through the project such as:
- Data Manipulation
- Data Visualization
- Probability & Statistics
- Importing & Cleaning Data
- Data Manipulation
- Data Visualization
- Case Studies

You can do the project yourself following this [link](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/projects/discovery-of-handwashing) on DataCamp using Python or R.
